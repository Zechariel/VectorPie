For use with RetroPie EmulationStation Fork.

This theme is designed for 16:9 aspect ratio, optimal 1920x1080.

This theme is designed to work in Basic View, Detailed View, and Video View.

Unfortunately, due to the current state of RetroPie's ES, it seems that you can only have about five systems/categories at once before Emulation Station wets itself, goes home, and refuses to play with you anymore. Or in other words, I believe that the limit is five systems/categories at 250MB VRAM; beyond that comes the "getError"s, resulting in white pages/images. As far as I can tell, it's still this way with all of the graphic heavy themes, E.g. Magazine Madness.
