For use with EmulationStation on RetroPie 4.6 or sooner on a Raspberry Pi 4 2GB and above.

This theme is designed for 16:9 aspect ratio, optimal 1920x1080.

This theme is designed to work in Basic View, Detailed View, and Video View.

Comments, suggestions, problem/mistake/error reports, and requests are always welcome but best left on the RetroPie Forum thread: https://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/19198/new-es-theme-vectorpie-16-9, or the GitHub page: https://github.com/Zechariel/VectorPie

Installation: Currently the best way to install VectroPie on a Raspberry Pi is to use Samba shares to connect to your Pi and place the entire contents of the downloaded zip into /RETROPIE/configs/all/emulationstation/themes/VectorPie. If there is not already a folder named "themes" you can simply create one, and of course you will have to create the VectorPie folder as well.
